  ## Project Name
  README-generator

  ## Installation
  To create this README generator, installation of Node.js was required. Following the installation of Node, " npm Init -y"  and " nmp install Inquirer" was required for installation. Without those components, this code would not be able to run correctly and the README would not be generated. 

  ## Usage
  This project is used to quickly create markdown files for projects. To be able to use this application, "node index.js" must be run for the file in the terminal. Questions for the markdown will appear in the terminal, and once all questions are answered, markdown file will be created.
